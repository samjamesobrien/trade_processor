# trade_processor
toy project using dropwizard designed to be deployable to Heroku


#### Things I didn't have time to do

- Proper test coverage
- security and authentication
- more interesting metrics and processing using rxjava Observable streams
- more Interfaces, refactoring and more providers with configurable fields


Sample Query using curl
-----------------------

Jackson validates these and will reject malformed objects

Submit a trade

`curl -i -X POST {location}/api/trade  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"userId":"1234","currencyFrom":"EUR","currencyTo":"GBP","amountSell":100,"amountBuy":74.73,"rate":0.7473,"timePlaced":"10-JAN-16 10:30:30","originatingCountry":"FR"}'`

Get a users trades

`curl -i -X GET {location}/api/trade/1234  -H "Content-Type: application/json"`

The index page

`curl -i -X GET {location}/`


Currency values
---------------

Currency and exchange rates are stored to 6 decimal places, but exposed with 4.


Heroku configuration
--------------------

Heroku provides some environment variables for the port you need to bind to, and the database url including credentials.

In the Procfile we honor these environment variables, overriding fields set in the .yml.

Interestingly we cannot run arbitrary maven commands on Heroku, so everything that needs to be done such as db migration
or configuring classes from environment variables is run automatically by the component itself.

For the database, we have a modified getter which parses the Heroku environment variable if present and overrides our configuration.


Rate limiting
-------------

Configurable per user rate limiting has been implemented using guavas RateLimiter class.
Per user RateLimiter objects are cached.


Trends - Processing
-------------------

Persistence and processing metrics are performed in a separate thread pool to the API calls, ideally this speeds up message
ingestion. The calculated metrics are very simple, and pushed to a web socket.
The metrics are calculated every 500 milliseconds and pushed to the websocket.

Dependency Injection
--------------------

...was not used. For this project I opted against dependency injection although it would have worked just fine for this use case.
However I have always used Guice in Dropwizard so decided not to this time.


Garbage Collection
------------------

The App instance has a GarbageCollector, it just checks the DB every 10 minutes and deleted entries older than 30 minutes.


Flyway & database migration
---------------------------

Upon succesfully starting up and connecting to the database, the component will automatically perform the database migration, creating tables etc.

You can also run:

    `mvn clean compile flyway:migrate`


Run the component
-----------------

###### Note - for non Heroku usage, set the database credentials in your .yml as per the flyway config in the pom.xml

    `java -jar target/trade_processor-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar server config.yml`


Clear the h2 db
---------------

For local development without needing postgres, h2 is used, it creates .db files in lieu of a proper database.

    `rm *.db`
